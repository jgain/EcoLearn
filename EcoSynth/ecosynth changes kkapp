changes to ecolearn interface:

- able to import landscape files from 16-bit PNGs now. I have allowed it to import without any latitude info. Perhaps we can separate this from the landscape import? You will need libpng 1.6 for this to work though, so if you do not feel like installing this library and you do not want to work with 16-bit PNGs, you can just comment out the Terrain::loadPng function, and take out the relevant part in the Window::openTerrain function.
- Program doesnt crash if the landscape gets clicked on when a terrain hasn't been loaded yet (added a check for whether the 'ter' pointer in the current scene is NULL)
- Can press numbers from 0 to 2 for different painting classes. Previously numbers were pressed to view certain plant functional types, but this is now only true if we are in VIEW mode. If numbers are pressed in PAINTLEARN mode, the painting class is adjusted instead.
- Changed the TypeMap::saveToGreyscaleImage to actually save now (it uses QImage now, instead of the CImg stuff). Also parameterised the function to use either row or column major order, rather than just column-major order. Also changed it so that it doesn't flip the y axis (necessary when writing CHM).
- Changed the TypeMap::convert function to use a different range in the case of TypeMapType::CHM. It used to use numSamples, but I am just using 250 now, since we have an actual CHM, and there is no need for categories.
- Changed the IPC::receive function to write the actual obtained value into the MapFloat object (this was necessary for the canopy height model read)
- Changed the TypeMap::convert call on the CHM (in glwidget.cpp) to use 65535 as a range, instead of the range that is derived from the maximum tree height. (the scaled outputs from the neural network is proportional to 65535, if I am not mistaken. It is scaled such that a tree of 400 feet (which we will never get) is at 65535).
- Plugged in the canopy placement. I added some files to the project for this, all in the canopy_placement folder under viewer. You will need some libraries for it to compile, though. These are all listed in the CMakeLists.txt file in the viewer directory, under the added_libs variable. If you want to compile it without the canopy placement stuff, it should work if you take out the canopy_placement files under GUI_SOURCES and leave out the added_libs from target_link_libraries. Then, in the glwidget.cpp file, under the case where Key_G is pressed, the canopy placement will run (the mosaic_spacing object). Just comment out this too. The canopy placement will not work now even if you have all the libraries, since I have not added some assets and shader files to the repository yet. I will do this tomorrow.
- There may be some more changes, but these were the most important ones I could think of
